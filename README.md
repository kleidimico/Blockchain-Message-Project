Built using the BuildSpace tutorial on smart contracts and web3.  

Main tutorial can be found here: https://buildspace.so/p/CO02cf0f1c-f996-4f50-9669-cf945ca3fb0b.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat and solidity use case. A smart contract was deployed to store messages that the user sends using the front end dApp. For every message sent, there is a 50% chance that the user will receive Eth back from the smart contract.  The contract is deployed on Rinkeby test network.

Follow this link to see the final product including the dApp built: https://waveportal-starter-project.kmic.repl.co/

Main files in this repo include:

-WavePortal.sol => the main smart contract code in solidity
-deploy.js => script to deploy the contract
-run.js => script to test transactions to the contract

This project uses the below languages and environments: 

-node.js
-hardhat
-javascript
-solidity
-css
-html
-react
